# Changelog

## **Version 1.0.5**

New
- Color picker option under appearance section in settings for custom accent colours in iOS 14. Due to a technical limitation in the implementation, it’s not possible to close/swipe down the color picker window. Once a custom accent color has been selected, kindly restart the application for changes to take effect. 
- Toggle for marking goals as completed automatically based on hitting target goal, both in settings and create/edit goal.

Bug Fixes
- Corrected logic in regards to calculating contribution additions and whether to mark a goal as complete.
- Corrected logic which prevented contributions past target amount. 
- Corrected visual layout bug in regards to a “big white block” appearing over the keyboard in iOS 14.
