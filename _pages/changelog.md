# Changelog

## **Version 1.0.7**

Happy New Year! This update may take some by surprise after a long period of radio silence, in which we apologise deeply for. Fear not, Savings has not been abandoned, although that may have been the impression, as it hasn’t been possible to remedy some of the issues and develop further on Savings before now, due to circumstances concerning private, work and education. Fortunately there is more planned for the future in terms of features, further improvements and fixes that will be rolled out as circumstances allow it. All feedback will be read and noted down, as done with previously submitted feedback and reported issues.

#### New

General

- Dropped iOS 13 support as user base is low, allowing for a more unified experience across the board.
- Toast message (drop down banner) will be shown in some occasions after executed actions.

#### Homescreen

- Minor refresh in homescreen layout, including reorganisation of the settings button to the “more” menu.
- Added quick filtering of current, archived and all goals via bottom toolbar on homescreen.
- Added icons for various sorting options.
- Added ability to mark goal as completed via Haptic Touch (long press).
- Added rounded border as extra indicator for completed goals.
- Restructured action buttons into a menu in the form of a single button, including adding a mark goal as completed option.

#### Settings

- Added more accent color for the selection to now match the preexisting Savings icons.
- Added icons to entries in settings for an easier overview.

### Improved

- Updated the color picker implementation to be completely based on SwiftUI (iOS 14), thereby improving functionality and ease of use.

### Bug Fixes

#### Settings

- Fixed visual issue in some settings sections.
- Fixed issue that would prevent enabling some settings, such as biometrics and notifications.

Thanks so much for using Savings! If you have a moment to leave a review in the App Store, we would really appreciate it.

## **Version 1.0.5**

New

Once a custom accent color has been selected, kindly restart the application for changes to take effect.
- Toggle for marking goals as completed automatically based on hitting target goal, both in settings and create/edit goal.

Bug Fixes

- Corrected logic in regards to calculating contribution additions and whether to mark a goal as complete.
- Corrected logic which prevented contributions past target amount.
